# Fantasy-Creature-Battle-Game-CPP
This game features 5 creature types who "battle" using random number generation.
Each creature type is outfitted with a specific profile for "Attack", "Defense", "Armor", and "Special Ability".
Creatures "face off" by determining "strength" and "defense" "die rolls", and calculating damage to the defender accordingly. (Armor values also incorporated.)
When a creature is victorious, "strength points" are restored based on a random number generator (for battles in subsequent rounds).
The overall victor is the player with creatures remaining in the "creature queue".
